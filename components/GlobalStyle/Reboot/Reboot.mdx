# What reboot does

## Document
 1. Change from `box-sizing: content-box` so that `width` is not affected by `padding` or `border`.
 2. Change the default font family in all browsers.
 3. Correct the line height in all browsers.
 4. Prevent adjustments of font size after orientation changes in IE on Windows Phone and in iOS.
 5. Setting @viewport causes scrollbars to overlap content in IE11 and Edge, so
 we force a non-overlapping, non-auto-hiding scrollbar to counteract.
 6. Change the default tap highlight to be completely transparent in iOS.
 7. IE10+ doesn't honor `<meta name="viewport">` in some cases.
 8. Shim for "new" HTML5 structural elements to display correctly (IE10, older browsers)

## Body
 1. Remove the margin in all browsers.
 2. As a best practice, apply a default `background-color`.
 3. Set an explicit initial text-align value so that we can later use the `inherit` value on things like `<th>` elements.
 4. Suppress the focus outline on elements that cannot be accessed via keyboard. This prevents an unwanted focus outline from appearing around elements that might still respond to pointer events.

## Content grouping
 1. Add the correct box sizing in Firefox.
 2. Show the overflow in Edge and IE.

## Typography
 1. Remove top margins from headings
 2. By default, `<h1>`-`<h6>` all receive top and bottom margins. We nuke the top margin for easier control within type scales as it avoids margin collapsing.
 3. Reset margins on paragraphs. Similarly, the top margin on `<p>`s get reset. However, we also reset the bottom margin to use `rem` units instead of `em`.

## Abbreviations
 1. Remove the bottom border in Firefox 39-.
 2. Add the correct text decoration in Chrome, Edge, IE, Opera, and Safari.
 3. Add explicit cursor to indicate changed behavior.
 4. Duplicate behavior to the data-* attribute for our tooltip plugin
 5. Prevent `sub` and `sup` elements from affecting the line height in all browsers.

## Links
 1. And undo these styles for placeholder links/named anchors (without href) which have not been made explicitly keyboard-focusable (without tabindex). It would be more straightforward to just use a[href] in previous block, but that causes specificity issues in many other styles that are too complex to fix.

## Correct element displays

## Always hide an element with the `hidden` HTML attribute (from PureCSS).
